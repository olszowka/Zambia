TITLE='Conflict Report - Not Registered'
DESCRIPTION='These require some thought.  If they are on less than 3 panels that are actually running (assigned), they did not earn a comp from programming this year.  If they are on 3 or more, reg needs to know to comp them. When we are more comfortable with this report, I can hide registered people. email zambia@arisia.org to request report changes.'

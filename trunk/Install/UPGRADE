In the Upgrade_dbase directory you'll find a series of files starting 
with a 2 digit number.  These are the database updates that need to be 
completed when you pick up the latest cvs checkout.   Without them 
certain functionality will not work.  

These updates are already applied to EmptyDbase.dump:
01_addpermtables.sql
02_pubstats.sql
03_pubstat_constraints.sql
04_divinfo.sql
05_PermissionAtoms_update.sql
06_some_participant_perms.sql
07_participant_write_perms.sql
08_add_brainstorm.sql
09_session_history.sql

I'm really not sure what the status of  DemoDbase.dump is.  It has at least the first 4. 

any further updates need to be applied

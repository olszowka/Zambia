Comments: 
  - This is a rough draft based on notes taken during an install.
  - You really want to read this whole file before doing anything.
  - Thanks for being our guinea pig and testing this out.
  - If you want to help revise this document, speak up! 

0 - Prep work

You need a server with: 
  - apache
  - php
  - mysql
Please test them and make sure they work.  

You need to decide on: 
  - database name          (zambiademo is used here in)
  - database user name     (zambiademo is used here in)
  - database user password (4fandom is used here in)
  - web install location   (/home/trg/public_html/zambiademo is used here in)

1 -  Create a database and a user

You need to have root access to the mysql instance to do this.   
If you don't please ask the person who does to do these 2 steps. 

    mysql -u root -p

    mysql> create database zambiademo;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all on zambiademo.* to 'zambiademo'@'localhost' 
    identified by '4fandom'; 
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

Splitting the privledge model to have an admin and a web user is 
on the list.  It should be fairly simple to accomplish. 
If you want to contribute this, please let us know. 

2 -  Setting up the database 

You'll need the account and the database created in step 1. 

    mysql -u zambiademo -p

    mysql> use zambiademo
    Database changed

    mysql> \. EmptyDbase.dump;
    Query OK ...   (snipped for sanity)

Now you have an empty database that is ready for use with Zambia

3 - Setting up the webpages 

Checking out the html and php code. 

   cd /home/trg/public_html
   cvs co -d zambiademo -r LATEST Zambia/webpages

You probably want to talk with us first and find out what revision is 
currently recommented.  LATEST should give you a generally functioning 
version.  If you are helping develop you'll want the head of the tree. 

4 - Tweak the code to use your database

You want to edit db_name.php  (how should be clear). 

The reports are currently a hack.  You need to edit 2 files in the 
reportqueries directory: gencsv.sh and genreports.sh
(This WILL go away.  In the meanwhile "grep zambiademo" is your friend.)

5 - Run the reports

    cd reportqueries
   ./genreports.sh
   ./genindex.sh
   ./gencsv.sh

These need to be run for the reports to update.   You might run them 
by hand or you can run them from cron.  Your choice.   
(I said the reports were a hack, right? )

Here is a fun line for you: 
3,17,38,48 * * * * (cd /home/trg/public_html/zambiademo/reportqueries ; ./genreports.sh ; ./genindex.sh ; ./gencsv.sh ) 1>/dev/null

6 -  Check it all out

http://zydeco.netbusters.com/~trg/zambiademo 

or whatever your URL is... 

Ah, an account for in zambia so you can log in.  That would be useful.  
Currently we are set up to take a feed from Congo.  There is a script 
to run on the Congo server to extract the needed information so it can
be loaded.   This script is named export_program_participants.sql
It generates sql that can be in turn loaded into zambia. 

However, that can be completely avoided.   Ummm... gosh... huh.   
This requires thought. 

7 - Backups are a good thing 

If you are changing php and html files, you'll need to talk to us about 
access to cvs check your changes into cvs.   

If you care about dbase content, see backup_mysql and clean_backups in the 
scripts directory.  You'll want to run them or something similar.

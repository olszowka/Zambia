We need consistency... here is the plan

contains configuration information that each conference should set: db_name.php

contains css information: Common.css  ParticipantSection.css  StaffSection.css

auto generated files that display a page (aka you can link to them)
  lowercasewithnounderscores.php

contains functions and constants that other pages use (not autogenerated)
  lower_with_underscore_functions.php
  db_functions.php           # for database related functions
  data_functions.php

file that displays a page and can be linked to  (not autogenerated) 

  StrongCaps.php
  StaffStrongCaps.php    # for staff only pages

file that processes a post operation and display the results 
(often by calling a function that is elsewhere)

  StrongCaps_POST.php

file that contains functions used by a page of the same name
(and not elsewhere.   If it is used elsewhere it needs to move)

  StrongCaps_FNC.php

shell script for report generation: gencsv.sh genindex.sh genreports.sh

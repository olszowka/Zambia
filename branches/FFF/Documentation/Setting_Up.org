* Before beginning

  There are some required programs to run the Zambia software.  The
  following programs must be running on whatever server is going to
  serve up your Zambia instance: (LAMP or WAMP (WAMP is untested))
  + apache
  + php
  + mysql
  + some form of email sending software (MTA)
  + SFTP/SCP

  Either on your staging machine (where you will be uploading the
  information from) or on your server (if you are loading directly to
  there) you must also have:
  + svn
  + text editing program

** Decisions
   You will need to decide the following before you install initially:
*** Standalone/Combination
    Is this system going to be a standalone system, or are you going
    to interface it with Congo, or another piece of registration software?
*** Webserver
    web install location (whatever directory you will be putting your
    files into).  Often something like /var/www/Zambia-Con or
    /home/username/public_html/Zambia-Con or the like.
*** db_name.php file
    This information will go in the db_name.php file when you install it.
**** Required information for the program to run:
   + database hostname (*DBHOSTNAME*) (If you are setting things up on
     the same machine that MySQL is running on, /localhost/ should be
     what you are using for *DBHOSTNAME*).
   + database username (*DBUSERNAME*)
   + database password (*DBPASSOWRD*)
   + database name (*DBNAME*)
   + your host name (*MYHOST*) (If you are setting things up on the same
     machine that MySQL is running on, /localhost/ should be what you
     are using for *MYHOST*) (this doesn't actually go in the file)
**** Extremely useful information:
     + Con name.
     + Zambia administrator email.
     + Brainstorm email.
     + Programming email.
     + Registration email.
     + Number of days the con will run (code works for 1-8 currently.)
     + Date and time the con will start (In the format of yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:DD for parsing purposes.  Suggested 00:00:00 for the start time.)
     + URL of the con (without the leading http:// in the URL.)
     + Logo for the con (gif, png, etc.)
**** Very useful information
     + Guests of Honor badgelist (if you have specific featured Guests of Honor, the badgeids get listed here, comma seperated.)
     + Prefered total number of sessions upper limit (so your presenters don't oversubscribe themselves 5 is good default for a 3-4 day con.)
     + Prefered daily number of sessions upper limit (3 is a good default.)
     + Availabilty Records (starting number of "availability" fields to render in the "when I am available" form, 8 is a goto default)
**** Description minimums and maximums
     + Maximum web biography character length (Some cons have a different limits for what is on the web, and what is in the book, 3000 characters is a good starting default.)
     + Maximum book biography character length (if there isn't a difference in the limit, set to the same as above.)
     + Minimum web precis character length (You need a precis description of at least this long to be acceptable, 10 as a good default.)
     + Maximum web precis character length (3000 as a good default.)
     + Minimum book precis character length (if there isn't a difference in the limit, set it to the same as above for these, as well.)
     + Maximum book precis character length 
     + Minimum precis title character length (You need a precis title of at least this long to be acceptable, 5 as a good default.)
     + Maximum precis title character length (50 as a good default.)
**** Other interesting settings
     + Are kids avaiable (This should probably be set to "FALSE", it is a hold-over from backwards compatibility.)
     + Is this a bilingual event (This should probably be set to "FALSE" due to it's lack of complete support across the system, and the next few elements in this list, ignored.)
     + What the second language is.
     + Title caption in second language.
     + Description caption in second language.
     + Biography caption in second language.
     + Duration in Minutes (Should probably be "FALSE": TRUE: in mmm; False: in hh:mm - affects session edit/create page only, not reports.)
     + Grid Spacer (The time divisions in the fixed grid produced, in seconds.  For example 1800 is 60 sec/min and 30 min, and a good default.)
**** The rest of the file should not have to change.
* Downloading
  If you are checking the code out directly on the hosting machine,
  replace the final "Zambia" with what you decided the web install
  location will be.  If not, you can rename it to whatever you wish to
  call your staging area.

  Please, check out the code from:

  svn co https://zambia.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/zambia/branches/FFF/ Zambia

* Local file setup
  There are certain localisms you want to set up, outside the svn
  tree. This is so (should you need to) if an upgrade to the code-base
  is desired, it can be done, without writing over your
  customizations.

  To begin the process change to your web install location.  There you
  should see a list of files, and you will add one called "Local".
  When done your list of files should be:
  These files you will have to create or modify.
** db_name.php
     Copy the example webpages/db_name_sample.php to Local/db_name.php
     as a start, and then put in the values you decided upon before
     starting the install process.
** FooterTemplate.html
     This is where you will put your standard footer, that will be
     below all the public pages, to customize the look and feel to
     match your event's presentation.
** HeaderTemplate.html
     This is where you will put your standard header, that will be
     above all the public pages, to customize the look and feel to
     match your event's presentation.
** Participant_Images
     If you choose to have images of your participants with their
     bios, make this directory, and any pictures that match the
     badgename of the participant will be put next to the bios.
** Verbiage
     If you wish to customize what is put forth to your participants,
     many of the pages allow for customization.  The list of them will
     grow as more are done.  Any information in these files will
     replace the default text.  Some examples of these files are:

that Sessions is the generic term we are using for all Events,
Classes, Panels, BOF/SIG/MnG, other activities, etc. </P>

  <LI>Bio/copy editing: Rupert
</UL></P>

<P>The general flow of sessions over time is: <UL> <LI>Brainstorm -
New session idea put in to the system by one of our brainstorm
users. The idea may or may not be sane or good.  It could be too big
or too small or duplicative.

  <LI>Edit Me - New session idea that a participant or staff member
entered.  An idea entered by a brainstorm user that is non-offensive
should be moved to this status.  These are still rough and may well
have issues.  Still could be duplicates.

  <LI>Vetted - A real session that we would like to see happen.  At
this point the language should be fairly close to final in the
description. Spell checking and grammar checking should have happened.
It needs have publication status, a type, kid category, division and a
room set.  Please check the duration (defaults to 1 hour) and the
various things the session might need (like power, mirrors, etc.)
This is the minimal status that participants are allowed to sign up
for.  Avoid duplicates (however the list is still approximately 3
times what will actually run).

  <LI>Assigned - Session has participants assigned to it.

  <LI> Scheduled - Session is in the schedule (do not set this by hand
as the tool actually sets this for you when you schedule it in a
room!)  The language needs to match what you want to see
<b>published</b>.

* Database setup
  You should already have mysql set up.  If mysql is not already set
  up, a good guide to setting up a mysql server is:

#+LaTeX: \begin{small}
  http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch34_:_Basic_MySQL_Configuration
#+LaTeX: \end{small}

  The pieces of information you will need are from the above decisions
  for the db_name.php file:

  + database hostname (*DBHOSTNAME*) (If you are setting things up on
    the same machine that MySQL is running on, /localhost/ should be
    what you are using for *DBHOSTNAME*).
  + database username (*DBUSERNAME*)
  + database password (*DBPASSOWRD*)
  + database name (*DBNAME*)
  + your host name (*MYHOST*) (If you are setting things up on the
    same machine that MySQL is running on, /localhost/ should be what
    you are using for *MYHOST*)
** Hosted server
  If you are going to have your database served from a machine that
  is running cpanel or some other menu-based software, the method of
  setting up your database should be documented there.

  The chances are your setup will have you:
  + create a database
  + create a MySQL user
  + add MySQL user to the database
  + grant them all privs.
** Your own MySQL Setup
   If you are setting up your own MySQL server, and need to set up the
   database by hand the following steps should work for you.  Don't
   forget to replace the instances of *DBHOSTNAME*, *DBUSERNAME*,
   *DBPASSWORD*, *DBNAME*, and *MYHOST* with the proper bits of information.

   + Log into the database: (it should ask you for your MySQL root password) 
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
   mysql -h*DBHOSTNAME* -p -u root
#+end_src
   + Create your database:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
   create database DBNAME;
#+end_src
   + Grant *DBUSERNAME* user access with the password of *DBPASSWORD*:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
   grant all on DBNAME.* to 'DBUSERNAME'@'MYHOST' identified by 'DBPASSOWRD';
   grant lock tables on DBNAME.* to 'DBUSERNAME'@'MYHOST';
#+end_src
   + Reset the privilages
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
   flush privileges;
#+end_src
* Database populate
  change directories until you are in the Install directory, then:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
    mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME < ./EmptyDbase.dump
#+end_src
* Database tweaks
  Some of the tables in the database don't yet have appropriate
  front-ends, so, to customize them for your particular event, you
  will need to modify them directly from the MySQL client.  As
  development proceeds, these will get fewer over time.

  Currently, they are:
  + Divisions:: If you want some other divisions than Other,
    Programming, Events, Fixed Functions, Hotel, Unspecified, and
    Volunteer.
  + EmailCC:: Needs to be customized for your convention.
  + EmailFrom:: Needs to be customized for your convention.
  + EmailTo:: Might need to be customized.
  + Features:: List of things that can be in a room.  Might need to be
    customized.
  + Phases:: The "Phase" you are in will need to be changed as your
    phase changes.
  + PreconHours:: If you are tracking volunteer hours, the PreconHours
    will probably need to be added to.
  + PubStatuses:: Depending on the useage of the software, you might
    need more statuses than Prog Staff, Public, Do Not Print, and
    Volunteer.
  + QuestionsForSurvey:: You might want to change these.
  + RegTypes:: Depending on how you use it, the RegTypes may change.
  + Roles:: Fairly standard, but might want to be customized for your
    convention.
  + RoomSets: Fairly standard, but might want to be customized for
    your convention.
  + Rooms:: This definitely wants to be customized for your
    convention.
  + Services:: List of services that can be provided to a room.  Might
    need to be customized.
  + SessionStatuses:: Might need to be customized for your
    convention.
  + Tracks:: Probably will want to be customized for your convention
  + Types:: May want to be customized for your convention.

  Also, some of the Permission interconnects might have to be
  customized for your convention.

  One set of tables that you might be updating across the life of this
  instance of Zambia is the Reports table.  As people generate useful
  reports, they do tend to get shared.  We hope that, should you
  develop noteworthy reports, you share them back with the community
  at large, as well.

  Loading such reports are often as simple as:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
    mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME < ./NewReports.sql
#+end_src

  Sharing them is as simple as, say, exporting your new report called
  /voltimepanelists/:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
    echo "SELECT * FROM Reports WHERE reportname='voltimepanelists';" | 
    mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME > ./NewReports.sql
#+end_src

* Account creation
** Standalone
   If you are going to be using Zambia and not some other registration
   package, you are going to need access to the program, to begin
   adding the people who are going to be working with the system.

   Currently the easiest way to do so is to add the first three users,
   by pulling in the Initial_Users.sql file from the /Install/
   directory.

#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
    mysql -hDBHOSTNAME -p -uDBUSERNAME DBNAME < ./Inital_Users.sql
#+end_src

   Once you have done that, you can log in to Zambia using the badgeid
   of *101* and the password of *changeme*.

   You then can modify the appropriate information.  Under the /Manage
   Participants & Schedule/ tab, there is an /Administer Participants/
   choice.  Selecting that will allow you to update your password
   (_important step_) and the "Edit Further" link at the bottom of
   the page will allow you to update the information so it actually
   matches you.

   Feel free to then go and add the rest of your staff, off of the
   /Enter Participants/ link.
** Congo
   You might want to complete the activites above, just to make sure
   you have access, but once you do, you can migrate the congo data
   into the system, so all the other folks have their information
   added.

   From congo, do:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
    export_program_participants_congo.sql
#+end_src

   This generates sql that can be, in turn, locaded into Zambia.

** Not Congo
   Tying this into another registration system is slightly more
   complicated.  The easiest way is to use the "regtype" field to
   track the registration number that the various other registration
   programs give you, and see if there is a way to massage their data
   into the "CongoDump" format.
* First steps
** Schedule
   Establishing the schedule of activities in the form of a "todo"
   list is probably the first thing you wish to do.

#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
     YourWebPath/webpages/genreport.php?reportname=tasklistdisplay
#+end_src

   Replacing, of course /YourWebPath/ with the proper URL to get to
   your Zambia-FFF branch install.
** Brainstorming
   The Brainstorming links should work immediately.  From the top
   directory (index) page of your site, you should be able to click on
   the "Suggest a Session/Presenter" button and get right into it.
* Backing up
  Under the /scripts/ directory there is a nice little shell-script
  that you can call with cron to back your information up.  If you are
  to use it, make sure you create the /Data_Backup/ directory under
  the /Local/ directory before you use it.  I back up weekly several
  months before the con, start in on daily once heavy changes are
  being made, so we loose less information if there is a problem, and
  then about a month or so after the con, back off to weekly or
  monthly.  At one point in time, I was running it hourly, just to be
  sure.

  The script is invoked as:
#+begin_src html :exports both :results silent
  backup_mysql /your/path/to/Zambia-FFF/instance
#+end_src

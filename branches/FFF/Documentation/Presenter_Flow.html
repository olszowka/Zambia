<h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Introduction </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">


<p><br/>
There is a certain pattern to the flow of dealing with presenters,<br/>
whether they are sought after as Guest Of Honor, or as presenters on<br/>
specific subjects, or as individuals that people have suggested, and<br/>
how to get them successfully into Zambia.  This section of the<br/>
documentation will be referencing some things only available to<br/>
SuperLiaison individuals, so if you do not have that designation,<br/>
this document might not be very useful to you in terms of work-flow,<br/>
but it is always good to have an understanding on how things go on.<br/>
Please do not let that deter you from enjoying this document.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Entering Presenters </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">


<p><br/>
There are two basic paths for entering Presenters into Zambia,<br/>
either they are entered via outside suggestion (by someone, possibly<br/>
the presenter themselves) when the call for presenters is open, or<br/>
by someone on the Liaison Team entering their information, because<br/>
negotiations by another channel of communications has happened.  If<br/>
the presenter is already in the system, either said presenter or a<br/>
member of the Liaison Team can indicate their interest without<br/>
rentering their data. In this case, go directly to the next section.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-2_1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-2_1"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> Ouside Suggestions </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2_1">


<A HREF="../webpages/BrainstormSuggestPresenter.php">BrainstormSuggestPresenter.php</A>

<p><br/>
Depending on your convention, many of the folks who are going to<br/>
present either applied to do so (once you put the call for<br/>
presenters) or are recommended by other folk.  Either way they<br/>
will probably have been entered in the Brainstorm Suggest a<br/>
Presenter form.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<div id="fig:Zambia_Presenter_Flow_Brainstorm_Suggest_Presenter" class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/Brainstorm_Suggest_Presenter.png"  alt="./Images/Brainstorm_Suggest_Presenter.png" /></p>
<p>Brainstorm Suggest Presenter</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on the individual, you<br/>
might not even have enough information to track them down and<br/>
invite them but most people are good at putting in the<br/>
information.  Once presenter information is entered, most of it<br/>
will be in the "NotesOnPresenter" element, looking much like:<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<div id="fig:Zambia_Presenter_Flow_Notes_On_Presenter" class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/Notes_On_Participant.png"  alt="./Images/Notes_On_Participant.png" /></p>
<p>Notes On Presenter</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
The element appears at the bottom of a presenter administration<br/>
screen.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
Hopefully their name and email address will be in their profile<br/>
should you desire to contact them.  Hopefully it will also include<br/>
the email address of the submitter, so if the information they<br/>
submitted doesn't actually connect you, or is incorrect, they will<br/>
be helpful in facilitating the contact.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p></div>

</div>

<div id="outline-container-2_2" class="outline-3">

<A HREF="../webpages/StaffEditCreateParticipant.php?action=create">StaffEditCreateParticipant.php</A>

<p><br/>
Often a Liaison person is tapped to enter in a participant because<br/>
of negotiations done using other chanels.  Entering in the<br/>
Presenter's information is slightly more comprehensive on the Enter<br/>
Participant page which can also be found by going to the "Manage<br/>
Participant &amp; Schedule" tab, and then choosing the "Enter<br/>
Participants" link.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>

<p>Add Participant</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p><ul>
<li>
In the names section, the first name, name for publications and<br/>
badgename (the last two should be the same) are most<br/>
important. The last name, although not mandatory, is often useful<br/>
for disambiguation purposes.  The "Populate Defaults" button is<br/>
mostly useless in our circumstances, being that it simply puts<br/>
the first and last name in the publication and badge name<br/>
fields. <br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
The Will Participate and attend is very useful, but if you don't<br/>
know their state it is acceptable to leave that blank for now.<br/>
Unfortunately that will be problematic going forward beyond the<br/>
compensation elements, for they won't show up in the pull-down<br/>
menues until they are marked as "Yes". <br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
It is important for the email address to be all in lower case.  <br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Depending on the convention, the preferred way to be contacted<br/>
may be limited.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Make sure that the "Presenter" box is checked.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
The requirement level of the postal addresses for presenters is<br/>
convention dependant.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
The Biography elements are all the "raw" elements, i.e., what the<br/>
presenter themselves can see and edit.  Depending on how your<br/>
convention is organized, this might also be the final bio or it<br/>
might have several different stages to go through before it is<br/>
finalized.  The language in parentheses is only useful to note,<br/>
if your convention is multi-lingual. (e.g., en-us is english,<br/>
united states, fr-ca is french canadian)<br/>

<p><br/>
</p><ul>
<li>
Web is the bio shared on the web.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Book is what is being put in the convention book.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
URIs should be in fully-formed link format.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Pictures can be locally or remotely sourced.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Location should go away soon, don't worry about that.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
The alternative ways of contact is always useful, if the<br/>
presenters are willing to offer up one or more.  These can<br/>
include other email addresses, contact info for support people,<br/>
or other ways of being in touch with them.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
The Log Note will also end up at the bottom of your page, with<br/>
the rest of the Notes On Presenter elements.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Additional Participant notes are notes that follow their profile<br/>
around.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Phone number is for contact, but depending on the strictures of<br/>
your convention this might or might not be required.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Registration Type currently is a fill-in field that should be<br/>
filled in with 'PresenterComp" but will become a pull-down list<br/>
at some point.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Don't forget to hit the "Save" button, please.<br/>

<p>
Once in the system, the most common request by presenters is to have<br/>
their password reset so that they can update the rest of their<br/>
profile.  To do this, go to the Administer Participants link under<br/>
the Manage Participants &amp; Schedule tab.  Select the presenter from<br/>
the drop-down menu and, once selected you may change their password,<br/>
their interested and available setting, and their published name.<br/>

<p>Administer Participants</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
Most of the other modification pages won't have the presenter in the<br/>
select menu until they are marked as a "Yes", as previously<br/>
explained.  This is one of the pages that all the potential<br/>
presenters are available in the pull-down menu.  If they are not<br/>
available here, they might still be in the system, just not marked<br/>
as someone you can see.  If you think they should already be in the<br/>
system, and aren't showing up, please check with someone with<br/>
greater permissions, or other div-heads.  They may already be in the<br/>
system, just under another division.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
At the bottom of the Admin Participants page, there are several<br/>
different links.  The next-most useful page is the first one: "Edit<br/>
PUBNAME further". When using the direct link, you will need to<br/>
reselect the participant from the top of the page.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
<A HREF="../webpages/StaffEditCreateParticipant.php?action=edit">StaffEditCreateParticipant.php</A>

This link will take you back to the page you should be familiar<br/>
with, when you were creating the participant.  You can add to or<br/>
change any of the extant information at this time.  If you want to<br/>
see the importance of the fields, please see section on<br/>
<a href="#StaffEditCreateParticipant.php">StaffEditCreateParticipant.php</a> for diagram and instructions.<br/>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">


<A HREF="../webpages/StaffEditCompensation.php">StaffEditCompensation.php</A>

<p>
There are two ways to reach the place to enter Compensation for a<br/>
Presenter.  One way is to go to the bottom of the Admin Participants<br/>
page mentioned in the last section, then select the second link:<br/>
"Set Compensation for PUBNAME".  When using the direct link, you<br/>
will need to reselect the participant from the top of the page.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<div id="fig:Zambia_Presenter_Flow_Compensation_Update" class="figure">
<p><img src="./Images/Compensation_Update.png"  alt="./Images/Compensation_Update.png" /></p>
<p>Compensation Update</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
Only fill in the applicable compensation fields.  Please don't<br/>
forget to hit "Update" before leaving the page.  Compensation is<br/>
very conference dependant, please make sure any compensation entered<br/>
is in lines with your conference's policies.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
You can also select the presenter name from the Presenter<br/>
Compensation table.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>

<p>Compensation Information</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
This table will fill in with the information entered.  The notes<br/>
display makes it a very big table, hence the option without notes is<br/>
the default.<br/>

<div id="outline-container-5" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Entering Schedule Elements offered </h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">


<p><br/>
There are a few ways that Schedule Elements get entered into Zambia.<br/>
A Schedule Element is anything that might end up on the schedule.<br/>
This could be an Author Reading, a performance, a hosted meal, a<br/>
class, a panel, a keynote speech, or anything else that is schedule<br/>
worthy. <br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
The information entered is visible to anyone who chooses to look at<br/>
the website.  So people interested in what the decision process<br/>
might be, or are looking to see if what they proposed is already<br/>
under consideration, they can see much of the information.  This<br/>
gives the community some sense of what is going on, so being<br/>
descriptive about the information entered is a good thing.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
Once a Schedule Element is entered, if it is to be associated with a<br/>
particular individual or set of individuals, that is done in several<br/>
ways.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-5_1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-5_1"><span class="section-number-3">5.1</span> Outside suggestion </h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_1">


<A HREF="../webpages/BrainstormCreateSession.php">BrainstormCreateSession.php</A>

<p><br/>
The Schedule Elements entered in from the outside, or by a<br/>
presenter themselves, will have certain fields filled in, but not<br/>
others.  Hopefully the submitter has given sufficient information<br/>
in the form for you to determine if the Schedule Element is<br/>
worthwhile, appropriate, or fits within this particular event.<br/>
They might have also suggested a specific person for the Schedule<br/>
Element.  The information asked for should be fairly<br/>
straight forward. This is found on the Brainstorm screen under the<br/>
Suggest a Session tab.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_2">


<A HREF="../webpages/CreateSession.php">CreateSession.php</A>

<p>
This form isn't overly complex, but there are some very important<br/>
pieces here.  This can be found from the "Create a New Session"<br/>
link under the "Manage Sessions" tab.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>

<p>Add New Session</p>
</div>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
</p><ul>
<li>
The session number is just there for reference.  If the next step<br/>
in your flow is to directly assign a person to a session, then<br/>
note down the number for future reference (the next section).<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Division: Most probably going to be "Programming" but other<br/>
options are available.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Track: Finding the appropriate track is sometimes tricky if it<br/>
falls into multiple categories.  You may want to set this to<br/>
some variant of "General", or "I don't know", depending on the<br/>
decision of your particular convention.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Type: What type of offering it is.  Often "Panel" or "Class" but<br/>
might be something else.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Pub. Status (Publication Status): Describes if it is closed to a<br/>
certain set of people, or only interesting to them, but most<br/>
often will be "Public".<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Title and Subtitle: Some conventions have limits on the length of<br/>
these, and how they are published.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Invited Guests Only: If this is going to be given by a<br/>
pre-scripted specific person, or set of people, this should be<br/>
checked, so other presenters cannot sign up to present for this<br/>
Schedule Element.  If it is unchecked, when Presenters look for<br/>
the list of Schedule Elements they are able to sign up for, this<br/>
Schedule Element will be amongst them.  This effects weather the<br/>
Prospective Participant Info below, is seen.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Sign up Req.? (Sign up Required): This is in place in case any<br/>
particular Schedule Element requires pre-con sign-up.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Est. Atten. (Estimated Attendance): This should be left blank,<br/>
since it is part of the feedback and history of the Schedule<br/>
Element after it is given.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Duration: This might be set by the convention, or might be<br/>
dependant on the Schedule Element, type of Schedule Element, or<br/>
many other things.  There should be a default time set here by<br/>
your convention.  This may or may not contain the break<br/>
between Schedule Elements, again depending on the decision of<br/>
your particular convention.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Room Set: Most room-sets will be standarized by your convention,<br/>
but sometimes a presenter has a particular preference that can<br/>
be accommodated.  Most often "class room", "theater", or<br/>
"unspecified" will be your choice.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Status: If you are just entering the Schedule Element, and it has<br/>
not been previously negotiated as a Schedule Element that has<br/>
been confirmed, please set it as "Brainstorm".  If it has been<br/>
accepted as definitely happening, "Vetted" is the level it should<br/>
be set to.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Web Description: This is the description of the Schedule Element<br/>
that will be on the website, once it is scheduled. It is shared<br/>
with the Brainstorm page until then. Because of this, please<br/>
enter an accurate description of the Schedule Element.  There may<br/>
be length constraints (on both ends) for the description.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Program Book Description: This is the description of the Schedule<br/>
Element that will end up in the publications.  It doesn't need to<br/>
be entered immediately (especially if the Schedule Element has<br/>
not yet become "Vetted"). There are probably has greater<br/>
restrictions on the length, due to the web costing less for space<br/>
than publications do.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Prospective Participant Info: This information gets shared with<br/>
all the Presenters, if the Schedule Element is not restricted by<br/>
the "Invited Guests Only" checkbox being checked.  This<br/>
information is available in the area where Presenters may choose<br/>
to sign up for this Schedule Element.  Things like "need at least<br/>
three years experience in the publishing field, from the<br/>
publisher's point of view" or the like would go in this field.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Notes for Participants: If you have yet to assign the Schedule<br/>
Element to someone in the system who has said "Yes", then their<br/>
name should be put in this field.  When Schedule Elements are<br/>
actually vetted and scheduled, then this field should be any<br/>
particular notes that will be shared with the presenter or<br/>
presenters, in their schedule.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Notes for Tech and Hotel: This is any of the notes that will go<br/>
to logistics, beyond the Features and Services requests below.<br/>
Like "will need to shift around the table, with the assistant on<br/>
it, in the middle of the class".<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Notes for Programming Committee: If this was a Schedule Element<br/>
submitted via the Brainstorm Submit a New Session (see above) then<br/>
any notes not specifically in the Schedule Element description<br/>
end up here.  If you want to put commentary here, notes about the<br/>
Schedule Element, why it was requested, who saw it elsewhere, if<br/>
it fits into multiple tracks, or the like, this is the place to<br/>
make such notations.<br/>

<p><br/>
</p></li>
<li>
Features and Services: These are pick-lists that you can choose<br/>
various features of the room, or services that should be provided<br/>
for the room, for the paricular Schedule Element.  Everything<br/>
from a CD Player to a Flush Toilette should be covered here.  If<br/>

be added to the select boxes here.<br/>

The presenter is taken to the outside suggestion section and asked<br/>
to fill out the form there.  It will have their name associated<br/>
with it directly, as opposed to "Idea Suggestion" as the suggesting<br/>
individual.  This will allow for the association between them and<br/>
the Schedule Element to be clean and fast.<br/>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5_4">


<p><br/>
Most conventions only want to assign Presenters to Schedule<br/>
Elements, after said element has become vetted, but not all<br/>
convetions work that way.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
If you want to assign a particular Schedule Element to an<br/>
individual or group of Presenters, make sure said individual or<br/>
group have already been set to "Yes" in terms of being willing to<br/>
present for your convention.  The next step is to find the Schedule<br/>
Element in question.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
One way is to look under the "Manage Sessions" tab at the View All<br/>
Sessions link.  Find the Schedule Element, then select the link<br/>
provided by the number (not the title).<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
A second way is also under the "Manage Sessions" tab, using the<br/>
link "(Precis View With Links)".  Find the Schedule Element, then<br/>
select the link provided by the number (not the title).<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
A third path to the Schedule Element in question is still under the<br/>
"Manage Sessions" tab. Enter the noted session id number in the<br/>
"Session ID:" box at the bottom of that screen and hit the "Search"<br/>
button.  This should bring up just one record (the record that you<br/>
are expecting, hopefully), again simply select the link provided by<br/>
the number (not the title).<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
The fourth and fifth path presume that you have already marked the<br/>
class as "Vetted", otherwise it will not show up for either of<br/>
these.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
A fourth path is still under the "Manage Sessions" tab, using the<br/>
"Edit an Existing Session" link.  Not only will this allow you to<br/>
select your Schedule Element from the pull-down list of possible<br/>
Schedule Elements and edit the information that might have changed<br/>
since it was submitted, but also if you select the link provided by<br/>
the "Session #" number, you will be in the right place.<br/>
</p>
<p><br/>
A fifth path is under the "Manage Participants &amp; Schedule" tab,<br/>
using the "Assign participants to a session" link and choosing the<br/>
Schedule Element from the pull-down menu at the top of the page.<br/>
<A HREF="../webpages/StaffAssignParticipants.php">StaffAssignParticipants.php</A>

Once you are on the "Assign Participants" page with the correct<br/>
Schedule Element, go to the bottom of the page where the "Assign<br/>
participant not indicated as interested or invited." pull-down menu<br/>
is located and select the presenter applicable then hit the "Add"<br/>
button.  The presenter will now show up with their "Assigned" box<br/>
checked.  If this particular Schedule Element has had other<br/>
presenters invited, or had other presenters expressed interest in<br/>
being part of this particular Schedule Element, that individual<br/>
will also show up here.  They might have their Assigned box checked<br/>
or not, if that Schedule Element has been associated with that<br/>
individual.<br/>

<p><br/>
Once all the potential Schedule Elements are in place, then comes<br/>
the delight of choosing which elements will be part of your<br/>
convention, when they will happen, and which will have to be<br/>
left for other conventions.  This is mostly dependant on the path of<br/>
each convention, and is therefore outside the scope of this document<br/>
to dictate.  There are several useful reports that might help with<br/>
this process, listed in the appendix.<br/>

  - This document is still pretty rough.
  - You really want to read this whole file before doing anything.
  - If you want to help revise this document, speak up! 

0 - Prep work

You need a server with: 
  - apache
  - php
     - needs to have xsl and multibyte libraries installed and enabled
       (often, but not always, included by default)
  - mysql
  - an instance of smtp which will relay from Zambia/php
       (optional; needed only if you want to send email from Zambia)
Please test them and make sure they work.  

You need to decide on: 
  - database name          (zambiademo is used here in)
  - database user name     (zambiademo is used here in)
  - database user password (4fandom is used here in)
  - web install location   (/home/petero/public_html/zambiademo is used here in)

1 -  Create a database and a user

You need to have root access to the mysql instance to do this.   
If you don't please ask the person who does to do these 4 steps. 

    mysql -u root -p

    mysql> create database zambiademo;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> grant all on zambiademo.* to 'zambiademo'@'localhost' 
           identified by '4fandom'; 
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.07 sec)

    mysql> grant lock tables on zambiademo.* to 'zambiademo'@'localhost' ;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    mysql> flush privileges;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.31 sec)

You may want to create multiple MySQL users with each having only the necessary privileges, e.g.
    administrator — Everything as shown above
    php user — SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and LOCK TABLES
    backup user — SELECT and LOCK TABLES

2 -  Setting up the database 

You'll need the account and the database created in step 1. 

    mysql -u zambiademo -p

    mysql> use zambiademo
    Database changed

    mysql> \. EmptyDbase.dump
    Query OK ...   (snipped for sanity)

Now you have an empty database that is ready for use with Zambia.  You may instead
use DemoDbase.dump or SampleDbase.dump.
    EmptyDbase.dump — only tables required for Zambia to run at all or with hard coded
        values are populated.
    SampleDbase.dump — contains data from EmptyDbase.dump plus the report configuration
        and some configuration data you will need to edit.  Also contains users “1” and
        “2” with password “demo”.
    DemoDbase.dump — contains data from EmptyDbase.dump, SampleDbase.dump, and some
        participant preference and schedule data.

3 - Setting up the webpages 

Checking out the html and php code. 

   cd /home/petero/public_html
   svn checkout svn://svn.code.sf.net/p/zambia/code/trunk/webpages zambiademo

You probably want to talk with us first and find out what revision is 
currently recommented.

4 - Tweak the configuration to use your database and specify other preferences

You want to copy db_name_sample.php to ../db_name.php  
and edit it as needed.  In other words, db_name.php should be in the parent
directory of Zambia, a directory which is not served by apache.  The file
db_functions.php loads this file, so you may edit the location if necessary.

5 -  Check it all out

http://zambia.dreamhosters.com/~petero/zambiademo 

or whatever your URL is... 

6 - Ah, an account for in zambia so you can log in.  That would be useful.  
Currently we are set up to take a feed from our registration system 
(namely Congo).  There is a script to run on the Congo server to 
extract the needed information so it can be loaded.   This script is 
named export_program_participants_congo.sql
It generates sql that can be in turn loaded into zambia. 

However, that can be completely avoided by using add_zambia_user in the 
scripts directory.   It comes with a sample way to add 2 accounts. 

If you use a different system for registration, a way to export your 
users out of it and add them into Zambia in an automated way should be 
feasible. 

7 - Backups are a good thing 

If you are changing php and html files, you'll need to talk to us about 
access to svn check your changes into svn.   

If you care about dbase content, see backup_mysql and clean_backups in the 
scripts directory.  You'll want to run them or something similar.

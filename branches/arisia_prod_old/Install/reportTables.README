The file reportsTables.dump contains schema and data for the tables which implement
the report engine.  These tables are included in EmptyDbase.dump, SampleDbase.dump, and DemoDbase.dump, but the data are included in only the latter two.

The plan is build scripts for importing from and exporting to an XML file so that the 
reports are more readily tracked by version control.  However, those scripts have not yet
been implemented.
